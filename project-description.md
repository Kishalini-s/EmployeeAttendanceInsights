# Employee Attendance Insights

## Project Description
This project analyzes employee attendance patterns, work-from-home (WFH) trends, and sick leave data. The goal is to identify insights about employee behavior, such as:
- Which days employees tend to take sick leave or work from home.
- Attendance trends over time.
- Patterns in work-from-home behavior.

## Motivation
With the rise of remote work and flexible attendance policies, understanding employee presence and leave trends has become critical. 
This analysis helps HR departments optimize attendance tracking, improve workforce planning, and make data-driven decisions about work-from-home policies.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Utilized for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards. Power BI enabled the integration of various data sources, the creation of calculated columns and measures, and the presentation of findings through an easy-to-use dashboard.
  
- **Excel**: Employee data was extracted from Excel files and used as the primary data source for the analysis. Excel also played a role in data exploration before it was imported into Power BI.

- **Power Query Editor**: Used for cleaning and transforming raw data. Key tasks included removing unwanted columns, merging data from multiple sheets, and applying necessary transformations to make the data analysis-ready.

- **Calculated Columns**: Created custom calculated columns in Power BI to derive new values like total attendance and sick leave days, based on employee records.

- **DAX Measures**: Created dynamic measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to calculate aggregates and trends, including total attendance, average sick leave days, and work-from-home percentages.

- **Data Visualizations**: Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with various visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps, to highlight key trends in employee attendance, sick leave, and WFH behavior.

## Features
- Visualize employee attendance trends over time.
- Track work-from-home and sick leave patterns.
- Interactive dashboard with slicers for filtering data.
- Aggregated views on employee presence and absence.
